Install mail service

    sudo yum install mailx

Install ssmpt

    yum install ssmtp

Configure gmail as smarthost

    vi /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

Update config

    # Use SSL/TLS to send secure messages to server.
    UseTLS=YES
    #IMPORTANT: The following line is mandatory for TLS authentication
    TLS_CA_File=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    AuthUser=gmail-user-email
    AuthPass=gmail-password
    FromLineOverride=YES
    mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
    UseSTARTTLS=YES

Also, make sure you disable Sendmail:

    service sendmail stop
    chkconfig sendmail off
    mkdir /root/.bakup
    mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /root/.bakup
    ln -s /usr/sbin/ssmtp /usr/sbin/sendmail

Test it

    echo "Message Body" | mail -s "Message Subject" receiver@example.com

Failed messages are placed in `dead.letter` in the senderâ€™s home directory.

If mail is sending from the command line but not through crontab, try changing FromLineOverride to NO in `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`.

You can also get more detailed logging by adding `Debug=YES` to `ssmtp.conf` - the extra logging goes to `/var/log/mail.log` or `/var/log/maillog`.
