[DotEnv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) is a great Gem to handle ENV vars in a Rails application.

[Here](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use) there is a table that summarizes the different files where to put the variables. It is reproduced below.

TL;DR

- safe, default values in `.env.development`. This goes in the repo.
- custom overrides in `.env.development.local` or `.env.local`
- other vars nonrelated to the app itself in `.env`

## List of priorities
